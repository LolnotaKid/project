            <h1>HOW MANY FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE?</h1>
            <p>Currently, there are 3 features available:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Full Screen</strong> - For those who can't see the full path and want to make it bigger.</li>
                <li><strong>Run VFX</strong> - Allows you to run the VFX's path to see how it looks. There's also a "Generate" button that converts the VFX path into a script so you can use it.</li>
                <li><strong>VFX Stealer</strong> - Steals VFXs from the current game. <br>
                    <strong>How to use it:</strong> You must be in the game where you want to extract the VFX. If you try using another game's path, it won’t work. Enter the current game's path, and it will generate a script for you. Now, you can play that VFX in any game.</li>
