            <h1>WHAT'S VEUX LOGGER</h1>
            <p>Veux Logger is a script for Roblox that finds all VFXs from the game. It's unnecessary for some people who don't use it, but we've done so many big updates on that!</p>
        </div>

            <h1>HOW MANY FEATURES ARE AVAILABLE?</h1>
            <p>Currently, there are 3 features available:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Full Screen</strong> - For those who can't see the full path and want to make it bigger.</li>
                <li><strong>Run VFX</strong> - Allows you to run the VFX's path to see how it looks. There's also a "Generate" button that converts the VFX path into a script so you can use it.</li>
                <li><strong>VFX Stealer</strong> - Steals VFXs from the current game. <br>
                    <strong>How to use it:</strong> You must be in the game where you want to extract the VFX. If you try using another game's path, it wonâ€™t work. Enter the current game's path, and it will generate a script for you. Now, you can play that VFX in any game.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>

        <!-- Premium Version Section (Hidden by Default) -->
        <div class="content-box hidden" id="premium-info">
            <h1>PREMIUM VERSION</h1>
            <p>Premium Version has so many features and supports all mobiles. It loads using a method that prevents game freezing or long load times.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box hidden" id="premium-features">
            <h1>FEATURES?</h1>
            <p>The Premium version provides faster scripting, and bugs get fixed sooner than in the free version. You can also create your own custom VFX and more.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="content-box hidden" id="premium-cost">
            <h1>COST</h1>
            <p>It costs <strong>15,000,000 ðŸª™</strong> and grants you the **Premium Role**.</p>
